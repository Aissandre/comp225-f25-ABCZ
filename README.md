# 😱🫣 Silly Stealth Assassins

Silly Stealth Assassins is a fun and strategic Roblox game where players are tasked with eliminating every other player and becoming the last one standing **BUT there’s a catch**.

All players are visually indistinguishable from each other *and* from the NPCs roaming the map. To survive, players must blend in, mimic NPC behavior, and carefully observe their surroundings to identify who might secretly be another player. Someone behind you could be a peaceful NPC… or a player waiting for the right moment to strike.

The game takes inspiration from the classic Mineplex (Minecraft) minigame **Sneaky Assassins**, which similarly revolved around players disguising themselves as NPCs while navigating a shared space. Our goal was to revive this concept using Roblox’s platform while expanding on the original idea with new mechanics that introduce more action, strategy, and unpredictability.
